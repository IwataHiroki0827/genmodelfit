Every command and option of `genmodelfit` on one page: what each command does, its options, what it reads and
writes, and its exit codes. The same text is printed by `genmodelfit <command> --help`.

## Common tasks

| What you want | Command | More |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `pipx install genmodelfit` (or `uv tool install genmodelfit` / `pip install genmodelfit`); to try without installing, `uvx genmodelfit recommend` | [README, "Install"](../README.md#install) |
| `genmodelfit` is "not found" after installing | pipx / uv tool: run `pipx ensurepath` / `uv tool update-shell` once and open a new terminal; pip: `python -m genmodelfit recommend` with the Python you installed it into | [below](#if-genmodelfit-is-not-found) |
| See which models run on this PC | `genmodelfit recommend` | [README, "Quick start"](../README.md#quick-start) |
| Find a model of one type (music here) | `genmodelfit recommend -m music` (or `genmodelfit search <word>`) | [`recommend`](#genmodelfit-recommend), [`types`](#genmodelfit-types) |
| See everything that runs, in one table | `genmodelfit fit` | [`fit`](#genmodelfit-fit) |
| Check one model (files, licenses, estimate) | `genmodelfit info "Z-Image-Turbo"` | [`info`](#genmodelfit-info) |
| Put a model into ComfyUI (first time) | `genmodelfit download "Z-Image-Turbo" --list`, then the same without `--list` | [download.md](download.md) |
| Change where downloads go | `genmodelfit config set comfyui-dir D:/ComfyUI` (once only: `--comfyui-dir D:/ComfyUI`) | [download.md, "genmodelfit config"](download.md#genmodelfit-config) |
| ComfyUI is not found (`download` / `measure`) | add `--comfyui-dir D:/ComfyUI` (or set it once with `genmodelfit config set comfyui-dir D:/ComfyUI`) | [download.md, "Choosing the place"](download.md#choosing-the-place) |
| Get the latest model list | `genmodelfit update --from-release` | [`update`](#genmodelfit-update) |
| Judge another PC | `genmodelfit recommend --vram 12 --ram 32` | [README, "Judge another PC"](../README.md#judge-another-pc) |
| Use it from a script or an app | add `--json`; to download also `--yes` and the place (`--comfyui-dir`, or `genmodelfit config` / `GENMODELFIT_COMFYUI_DIR`): without a decided place nothing is downloaded (exit code 1) | [schema.md](schema.md) |
| Switch the language | `genmodelfit config set lang ja` (once only: `--lang ja`) | [Display language](#display-language) |
| Measure models and send the results | `genmodelfit share` (it finds ComfyUI, starts it if needed, measures for a few minutes and opens a pull request) | [CONTRIBUTING.md, "The easy way"](../CONTRIBUTING.md#the-easy-way-no-git-needed) |

## Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| fit level (`Status`) | How much of the memory a model needs on this PC (VRAM on the GPU, RAM on the CPU): `perfect` up to {perfect}%, `good` up to {good}%, `marginal` up to {marginal}%, `too_tight` above {marginal}% (does not run), `unknown` / `?` not judged (the size is not known). Some run modes cap the level: [README, "Fit levels"](../README.md#fit-levels). |
| runnable | `perfect`, `good` or `marginal` (what `fit` shows by default). |
| offload | Keeping part of the weights in RAM instead of VRAM and moving them over while running (`GPU+RAM`). It lets a model run on a smaller GPU, but slowly. "Without offloading" means `GPU` or `GPU~`. |
| run mode (`Mode`) | `GPU` everything on the GPU; `GPU~` the parts are moved onto the GPU one after another; `GPU+RAM` part of the weights is offloaded to RAM (slow); `CPU` (slow); `-` does not run. [README, "Columns"](../README.md#columns) |
| Score | 0–100, the memory headroom (100 up to 70% use). Not speed or quality. |
| model / workflow | A workflow is one ComfyUI template (or Hugging Face entry) with an id such as `image_z_image_turbo_int8`. A model is the weights (family + size) that several workflows share; they differ only in precision or use. Tables show one row per model (`--all-workflows`: one per workflow). `info` and `download` accept either. |
| use (`--task`) | What a workflow does inside its type: `gen`, `edit`, `i2v`, ... (`genmodelfit types` lists them). |
| the list (`db.json`) | The model list that genmodelfit judges. A copy comes with the package; `update --from-release` stores a newer signed one in the cache, which is then used instead (`--no-cache`: the bundled one; `--db PATH`: a file). |
| HEAD check | An anonymous HTTP HEAD request to each download URL, recorded in the list. Checks older than {head_days} days (`--max-head-age-days`) count as expired: those models are held until you run `genmodelfit update --from-release`. `system` shows the date. |
| Verified / auto / held | Verified (`auto` in JSON) means the model passed every check of the gate (licenses on the allowlist, official workflow, fresh HEAD checks, sha256 known, `sfw`, reviewed, ...), so an app may recommend it without asking a person. The others are held (`held_reasons`). [README, "Verified"](../README.md#verified-auto-recommendation), [gate.md](gate.md) |
| content (`sfw` / `uncensored`) | `uncensored` marks models without a safety filter or meant for adult output. They are hidden unless you pass `--uncensored` (both kinds) or `--content uncensored` (only those). [README, "Unknown-license and uncensored models are hidden by default"](../README.md#unknown-license-and-uncensored-models-are-hidden-by-default) |
| GB | Always GiB (1024³ bytes), also in `--vram`, `--ram` and `--budget`. |

## How to read this page

- Each command section has its purpose, the usage line, what it does, its own options, the options it shares with
  other commands (listed once in [Options shared by commands](#options-shared-by-commands)), what it needs, what it
  reads and writes, its exit codes and examples.
- In the usage line, `[...]` is optional, `A | B` means one of them, and `...` means it can be repeated.
- "Value" is what follows the option (`--vram GB`); an option without a value is a switch. "Default" is what is used
  when the option is left out.
- `-h` / `--help` and `--lang` work with every command and are listed only once (below).
- An option may be shortened to any unambiguous prefix (`--mod` for `--modality`), except the consent options
  `--uncensored`, `--any-license`, `--include-unknown-license` and `--content`, which must be written in full
  (`recommend --unc` is a usage error, exit code 2).
- Some options have the same name but do different things in different commands:
  - `--precision`: in `recommend`, `fit`, `search` and `info` the estimate is converted to that precision; in
    `download` it picks which workflow (which files) to download.
  - `--content`: in the listing commands it filters what is shown; in `download` it decides which models the name
    search looks at, and `uncensored` / `all` also count as consent to download uncensored models.
    `--uncensored` is the same as `--content all`; together with `--content sfw` or `--content uncensored` it is a
    usage error (exit code 2).
  - `--all`: everything in `fit` / `search`; the maintenance view in `diff`; approved entries too in `review list`;
    measurements already sent too in `share` (sent again) / `contrib share` (listed).
  - `--limit` / `-n`: rows in `recommend` / `fit` / `search`; lines per section in `diff`; suggestions listed in
    `measure`.
  - `--output` means different things in `update`, `bench` and `contrib`, and `--force` in `update` and `bench`
    (see each command).
- With `--json` every command prints JSON for programs; the shapes are in [schema.md](schema.md).

## If `genmodelfit` is not found

- pipx and uv tool put `genmodelfit` on PATH after a one-time `pipx ensurepath` / `uv tool update-shell`; then open a
  new terminal.
- After `pip install`, run `python -m genmodelfit …` with the same Python you installed it into (on Windows also
  `py -m genmodelfit …`). This does not reach pipx or uv tool installs, which have their own environments.
- pip may print *"WARNING: The script genmodelfit.exe is installed in '…\\Scripts' which is not on PATH"*. This is
  common with python.org Python installed without "Add python.exe to PATH", Microsoft Store Python, a user install
  (`--user`), or a venv that is not activated. Add that folder to PATH, or use `python -m genmodelfit`.
- A terminal opened before PATH changed does not see the change: open a new one.

## Table columns

The columns of `recommend`, `fit` and `search`:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Type` | image, video, music, sfx, tts, 3d |
| `Status` | the fit level ([Terms](#terms)) |
| `Score` | 0–100: memory headroom. 100 while `Mem%` is at most 70%, lower above; not speed, quality or popularity ([scoring.md](scoring.md#score)) |
| `Censored` | `Y` censored / `N` uncensored; only with `--uncensored` (or `--content all` / `uncensored`) |
| `Model` | one row per model (same weights); long names are cut in the middle with `…` |
| `Use` | `gen`, `edit`, `i2v`, … (`genmodelfit types`); the row's own use (the one matching `--task`) first, then the other uses of the model's workflows, without repeats (`gen,edit`; `gen,…` when they do not fit). The workflows: `info`; one row each: `--all-workflows` |
| `Prec` | the best precision that fits (fp16, bf16, fp8, int8, …) |
| `VRAM` | GiB needed in that mode; `m` = measured (by the maintainer, on this PC, or the median of other users' measurements of the same GPU; number of sources: `info`, JSON `sample_count`) |
| `Mem%` | share of the tightest memory used: VRAM on the GPU, RAM on CPU, the larger of the two for `GPU+RAM`; `RAM` = system RAM is short |
| `Mode` | `GPU` all on GPU, `GPU~` parts swapped in turn, `GPU+RAM` offload (slow), `CPU` (slow), `-` does not run (`GPU req`: needs a GPU, none usable here; `RAM`: not enough system RAM) |
| `Disk` | download size (GiB) |
| `License` | license of the files (`other` = read it yourself) |

`?` = unknown (precision, license, size; not judged on it). `-` = not applicable (does not run, no VRAM on CPU, …).
When the terminal is narrow, columns are dropped in the order given under [Display language](#display-language).

## Display language

Output is in English by default. For Japanese, use one of these:

- `--lang ja` on any command (e.g. `genmodelfit recommend --lang ja`)
- the environment variable `GENMODELFIT_LANG=ja`
- `genmodelfit config set lang ja` (saved; command line only)
- `gmf.set_language("ja")` in Python

The flag wins, then the variable, then the saved setting (command line) or `set_language` (Python). The OS language
is not used. Only the texts change: reasons, notes, errors, table headings and footers, and `--help`. JSON keys, ids,
codes and judgments are the same in both languages. English output contains no Japanese, and Japanese output
contains no English-only sentences (one language per line).

Kept in English in both languages: the table column names (`Type`, `Status`, `Score`, `Model`, `Use`, `Prec`, `VRAM`,
`Mem%`, `Mode`, `Disk`, `License`, `Censored`), the fit level names (`Perfect`, `Good`, `Marginal`, `Too tight`),
the run-mode marks (`GPU`, `GPU~`, `GPU+RAM`, `CPU`), units, and machine-readable values such as ids, license ids and
option names. This keeps the table widths stable and matches what you type for `--fit`, `--sort` and so on; the
Japanese output explains them in Japanese below the table. Type headings show the Japanese type name followed by
the name for `-m` (e.g. `(image)`).

Long lines are wrapped counting East Asian wide characters as two columns. File names, URLs, options and numbers with
units are never split (a single one longer than the width stays whole on its own line), and the basic Japanese
line-breaking rules apply (no line starts with a closing mark or comma, or ends with an opening bracket). When the
terminal is narrow, the table drops columns in this order: `Disk`, `Mem%`, `License`, `Prec`, `Use` (see them with
`info` or `--json`).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Used by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GENMODELFIT_LANG` | every command | Display language, `en` or `ja`. Beaten only by `--lang`. Values like `ja_JP.UTF-8` are accepted. |
| `GENMODELFIT_COMFYUI_DIR` | `download` | The ComfyUI folder to put files in. Beaten by `--comfyui-dir` / `--output-dir`; beats `genmodelfit config` and the automatic search. |
| `GENMODELFIT_COMFYUI_SEARCH` | `download`, `measure`, `share` | `0`, `off`, `no` or `false` turns the automatic search for ComfyUI off (for apps, scripts and tests). |
| `GENMODELFIT_COMFYUI_START` | `measure`, `share` | `0`, `off`, `no` or `false`: do not start the ComfyUI that was found when none is running (like `--no-start`). |
| `GENMODELFIT_CONFIG_DIR` | `config`, and every command that reads the saved settings | The folder of the config file `config.json` (default: see [Where files are kept](#where-files-are-kept)). |
| `GENMODELFIT_CACHE_DIR` | `update`, `measure`, `share`, `bench`, `contrib`, and every command that reads the cached list | The cache folder (default: see [Where files are kept](#where-files-are-kept)). |
| `GENMODELFIT_SIGNING_KEY` | `python -m genmodelfit.signing sign` only, not the `genmodelfit` command | The private key (PEM) that signs a data release. For the maintainer ([release.md](release.md)). |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` | `share` | A GitHub token used as it is to send the pull request (it needs the `public_repo` scope). Beats the saved sign-in and the device login. |
| `GENMODELFIT_GH_CLIENT_ID` | `share` | The client id of the GitHub OAuth app used for the device login. Empty turns the device login off (only `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN`). |

Network access also follows the usual proxy and certificate variables (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, ...);
`~/.netrc` credentials are never sent.

## Settings that can be saved (`genmodelfit config`)

`genmodelfit config set KEY VALUE` saves a setting in `config.json` in the config folder. Only the command line reads
it; the Python functions never do. The keys are `comfyui-dir` (a folder path) and `lang` (`en` or `ja`).
Where several places give the same setting, the first of these wins:

1. the command-line option (`--lang`, `--comfyui-dir`, `--output-dir`)
2. the environment variable (`GENMODELFIT_LANG`, `GENMODELFIT_COMFYUI_DIR`)
3. the saved setting (`genmodelfit config`)
4. the default (`lang`: `en`; the ComfyUI folder: found automatically when exactly one is found)

`genmodelfit config` shows each setting and which of these it came from. Details: [download.md](download.md).

## Where files are kept

| | Windows | macOS | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Config folder (`config.json`) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\genmodelfit` | `~/Library/Application Support/genmodelfit` | `~/.config/genmodelfit` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/genmodelfit`) |
| Cache folder | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\genmodelfit\\Cache` | `~/Library/Caches/genmodelfit` | `~/.cache/genmodelfit` (or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/genmodelfit`) |

`genmodelfit config path` prints the config file on your PC. `GENMODELFIT_CONFIG_DIR` and `GENMODELFIT_CACHE_DIR`
move the folders. The config folder also holds the GitHub sign-in of `share` (`github_token`, readable only by you;
`genmodelfit share --logout` removes it). The cache holds the list from `update` (`db.json`), the results of the HEAD and file-header checks,
your `measure` and `bench` results (`measurements/`, also used when this PC is judged), submission drafts
and failure records (`submissions/`, what `share` sends), the marks of what `share` has sent
(`submissions_shared.json`), the output of a ComfyUI that `measure` / `share` started (`comfyui-<date>.log`) and,
while measuring, `measure.lock` (only one `measure` / `share` measures at a time).
Deleting the cache folder is safe: the bundled list is used again (your saved results go with it).

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success. Running `genmodelfit` with no arguments prints the usage and exits 0. |
| 1 | Failure: no such model, a refusal, a declined question, a network error, an unreadable file, or a check that failed. Each command section says what counts as a failure. |
| 2 | Usage error: an unknown option, a wrong value, a missing argument, an abbreviated consent option, or options that cannot be used together. |
| 3 | Only `contrib aggregate --report --fail-on-breach`: an error exceeded the threshold. |
| 130 | Interrupted with Ctrl+C. `download` returns 130 on every OS and keeps the partly downloaded `.part` files; run the same command again to resume. Other commands stop the way Python does: 130 on Linux and macOS, 3221225786 (0xC000013A; PowerShell's `$LASTEXITCODE` shows -1073741510) on Windows. `bench` and `measure` first cancel their job (and stop a ComfyUI that genmodelfit started) and exit 1; `share` stops measuring, goes on to sending what was measured and then exits 130; `measure` and `share` return 130 when Ctrl+C is pressed at their questions. |

With `--json`, a failure still exits 1 and the message is in the `error` field of the JSON.

## About this page

The command sections are generated from the program's argument parser by `tools/cli_reference.py`, so they always
match the program. Do not edit them by hand; change the help texts in `src/genmodelfit/cli.py` and run
`python tools/cli_reference.py` (`tests/test_commands_doc.py` fails when this page is out of date).

The environment variables are read in `src/genmodelfit/i18n.py` (`GENMODELFIT_LANG`), `cli.py` (`GENMODELFIT_COMFYUI_DIR`), `comfyfind.py` (`GENMODELFIT_COMFYUI_SEARCH`), `comfystart.py` (`GENMODELFIT_COMFYUI_START`), `config.py`
(`GENMODELFIT_CONFIG_DIR`), `db.py` (`GENMODELFIT_CACHE_DIR`), `signing.py` (`GENMODELFIT_SIGNING_KEY`) and `github.py`
(`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, `GENMODELFIT_GH_CLIENT_ID`).

## 用語

| 用語 | 意味 |
|---|---|
| 段階(`Status`) | モデルがこの PC のメモリ(GPU なら VRAM、CPU ならメモリ)をどれだけ使うか: `perfect` は {perfect}% まで、`good` は {good}% まで、`marginal` は {marginal}% まで、`too_tight` は {marginal}% を超える(動かない)、`unknown` / `?` は判定していない(大きさが分からない)。動かし方による上限もある: [README「段階」](../README.ja.md#段階)。 |
| runnable | `perfect`・`good`・`marginal` のどれか(`fit` が既定で出すもの)。 |
| 逃がす(offload) | 重みの一部を VRAM ではなくメモリに置き、動かしながら GPU へ移すこと(`GPU+RAM`)。小さい GPU でも動くが遅い。「逃がさずに」は `GPU` か `GPU~` のこと。 |
| 動かし方(`Mode`) | `GPU` 全部 GPU に載せる、`GPU~` 部品を順に GPU へ載せ替える、`GPU+RAM` 重みの一部をメモリへ逃がす(遅い)、`CPU`(遅い)、`-` 動かない。[README「列」](../README.ja.md#列) |
| Score | 0〜100 のメモリの余裕(使用率 70% までは 100)。速さや品質ではない。 |
| モデル / ワークフロー | ワークフローは ComfyUI のテンプレート(か Hugging Face の項目)1 つで、`image_z_image_turbo_int8` のような ID を持つ。モデルは、いくつかのワークフローが共有する重み(系統 + 大きさ)で、ワークフローどうしは精度か使い方だけが違う。表はモデルごとに 1 行(`--all-workflows` ならワークフローごと)。`info` と `download` はどちらでも受ける。 |
| 用途(`--task`) | 種類の中でワークフローがすること: `gen`・`edit`・`i2v` など(`genmodelfit types` が並べる)。 |
| 一覧(`db.json`) | genmodelfit が判定するモデルの一覧。パッケージに 1 つ入っていて、`update --from-release` は署名つきの新しい一覧をキャッシュに置き、それからはそちらを使う(`--no-cache` で同梱、`--db PATH` でファイル)。 |
| HEAD の確認 | ダウンロードの URL のそれぞれに、名乗らずに HTTP の HEAD を送った結果(一覧に記録してある)。{head_days} 日(`--max-head-age-days`)より古い確認は期限切れで、そのモデルは `genmodelfit update --from-release` を実行するまで保留になる。日付は `system` で分かる。 |
| Verified / auto / 保留 | Verified(JSON では `auto`)は、gate の条件(ライセンスが許可リストにある・公式のワークフロー・HEAD の確認が新しい・sha256 が分かる・`sfw`・確認済み など)をすべて満たしたもので、アプリが人に尋ねずにおすすめに出してよい。満たさないものは保留(`held_reasons`)。[README「Verified」](../README.ja.md#verified自動でおすすめに出す条件)・[gate.ja.md](gate.ja.md) |
| 内容(`sfw` / `uncensored`) | `uncensored` は、安全フィルタを外したモデルや成人向けの出力を想定したモデルの印。`--uncensored`(両方)か `--content uncensored`(それだけ)を付けたときだけ出す。[README「ライセンス不明・無検閲のモデルは、既定で出しません」](../README.ja.md#ライセンス不明無検閲のモデルは既定で出しません) |
| GB | いつも GiB(1024³ バイト)。`--vram`・`--ram`・`--budget` も同じ。 |

    無検閲のモデルを落とす同意にもなる。`--uncensored` は `--content all` と同じで、`--content sfw` か
    `--content uncensored` と一緒に使うと使い方の誤り(終了コード 2)。
  - `--all`: `fit` / `search` では全部を出す。`diff` では保守用の内容を足す。`review list` では確認済みも出す。
    `share` では送ったことにした実測も送り直す、`contrib share` では一覧に出す。
  - `--limit` / `-n`: `recommend` / `fit` / `search` では行の数、`diff` では節ごとの行の数、`measure` では出す提案の数。
  - `--output` は `update`・`bench`・`contrib` で、`--force` は `update`・`bench` で、それぞれ意味が違う(各コマンドを見る)。
- `--json` を付けると、どのコマンドもプログラム向けの JSON を出します。形は [schema.ja.md](schema.ja.md) にあります。

## この PC を判定するコマンドの前提

`system`・`recommend`・`fit`・`search`・`info` の前提は次のとおりです。

{common_pre}

## `genmodelfit` が見つからないとき

- pipx と uv tool は、1 回だけ `pipx ensurepath`・`uv tool update-shell` を実行すると `genmodelfit` を PATH に
  通します。そのあと端末を開き直します。
- `pip install` で入れたなら、入れたのと同じ Python で `python -m genmodelfit …` を実行します(Windows では
  `py -m genmodelfit …` も可)。pipx と uv tool は専用の環境に入れるので、この方法では動きません。
- pip が *「WARNING: The script genmodelfit.exe is installed in '…\\Scripts' which is not on PATH」* と出すことが
  あります。python.org の Python を「Add python.exe to PATH」なしで入れた、Microsoft Store の Python、ユーザー単位で
  入れた(`--user`)、仮想環境を有効にしていない、のどれかでよく出ます。その場所を PATH に足すか、
  `python -m genmodelfit` を使います。
- PATH を変える前に開いた端末には反映されないので、新しい端末を開きます。

## 表の列

`recommend`・`fit`・`search` の表の列:

| 列 | 意味 |
|---|---|
| `Type` | image・video・music・sfx・tts・3d |
| `Status` | 段階([用語](#用語)) |
| `Score` | 0〜100。メモリの余裕。`Mem%` が 70% 以下なら 100、超えると下がる。速さ・品質・人気は入れない([scoring.ja.md](scoring.ja.md#score)) |
| `Censored` | `Y` 検閲あり / `N` 無検閲。`--uncensored`(か `--content all` / `uncensored`)のときだけ出る |
| `Model` | 同じ重みを 1 行にまとめたモデル。長い名前は真ん中を `…` で詰める |
| `Use` | `gen`・`edit`・`i2v` など(`genmodelfit types`)。行自身の用途(`--task` で合ったもの)を先頭に、そのモデルのほかのワークフローの用途を重複なく並べる(`gen,edit`。収まらなければ `gen,…`)。ワークフローの一覧は `info`、別々の行は `--all-workflows` |
| `Prec` | 載る中で一番良い精度(fp16・bf16・fp8・int8 など) |
| `VRAM` | その動かし方で要る GiB。`m` = 実測(メンテナ・この PC の実測、または同じ GPU のほかの利用者の実測の中央値。出どころの数は `info`・JSON の `sample_count`) |
| `Mem%` | 一番きついメモリの使用率。GPU なら VRAM、CPU ならメモリ、`GPU+RAM` は大きいほう。`RAM` = PC のメモリが足りない |
| `Mode` | `GPU` 全部 GPU、`GPU~` 部品を順に載せ替え、`GPU+RAM` メモリへ逃がす(遅い)、`CPU`(遅い)、`-` 動かない(`GPU req` は使える GPU が無いので動かない、`RAM` はメモリ不足) |
| `Disk` | ダウンロードの大きさ(GiB) |
| `License` | ファイルのライセンス(`other` = 自分で原文を読む) |

`?` = 分からない(精度・ライセンス・大きさ。判定に使っていない)。`-` = 当てはまらない(動かない・CPU なので VRAM が
無い など)。端末が狭いときに外す列の順は、[表示の言語](#表示の言語)にあります。

## 表示の言語

出力の既定は英語です。日本語にするには、次のどれかを使います。

- どのコマンドでも `--lang ja` を付ける(例 `genmodelfit recommend --lang ja`)
- 環境変数 `GENMODELFIT_LANG=ja` を置く
- `genmodelfit config set lang ja` で保存する(コマンドラインだけ)
- Python で `gmf.set_language("ja")` を呼ぶ

優先は `--lang`、環境変数、保存した設定(コマンドライン)か `set_language`(Python)の順です。OS の言語は見ません。
変わるのは文だけです: 理由・注意・エラー・表の見出しと説明・`--help`。JSON のキー・ID・コード・判定は、どちらの
言語でも同じです。英語の出力には日本語が出ません。日本語の出力には英語だけの文が出ません(1 行に 2 つの言語の文を
並べない)。

どちらの言語でも英語のまま出すもの: 表の列の名前(`Type`・`Status`・`Score`・`Model`・`Use`・`Prec`・`VRAM`・`Mem%`・
`Mode`・`Disk`・`License`・`Censored`)、段階の名前(`Perfect`・`Good`・`Marginal`・`Too tight`)、動かし方の印
(`GPU`・`GPU~`・`GPU+RAM`・`CPU`)、単位、ID・ライセンスの ID・オプションの名前など機械が読む値。表の幅をそろえ、
`--fit`・`--sort` などに書く名前と同じにするためです。日本語の出力では、表の下の説明がこれらを日本語で説明します。
種類の見出しは `== 画像 (image): …` のように、`-m` に書く名前も出します。

長い行は、全角を 2 桁で数えて折り返します。ファイル名・URL・オプション・単位つきの数の途中では切りません(1 つで
幅より長ければ、その行だけはみ出す)。行の頭に「、。)」を、行の終わりに「(「」を置きません。端末が狭いときは、
表の列を `Disk`・`Mem%`・`License`・`Prec`・`Use` の順に外します(外した列は `info` か `--json` で見る)。

## 環境変数

| 変数 | 使うところ | 内容 |
|---|---|---|
| `GENMODELFIT_LANG` | すべてのコマンド | 表示の言語。`en` か `ja`。`ja_JP.UTF-8` のような書き方も受ける。これに勝つのは `--lang` だけ。 |
| `GENMODELFIT_COMFYUI_DIR` | `download` | ファイルを置く ComfyUI のフォルダ。`--comfyui-dir` / `--output-dir` には負け、`genmodelfit config` と自動で探すのには勝つ。 |
| `GENMODELFIT_COMFYUI_SEARCH` | `download`・`measure`・`share` | `0`・`off`・`no`・`false` で、ComfyUI を自動で探すのを止める(アプリ・スクリプト・試験用)。 |
| `GENMODELFIT_COMFYUI_START` | `measure`・`share` | `0`・`off`・`no`・`false` で、起動中の ComfyUI が無いときに見つけた ComfyUI を起動しない(`--no-start` と同じ)。 |
| `GENMODELFIT_CONFIG_DIR` | `config` と、保存した設定を読むすべてのコマンド | 設定ファイル `config.json` のフォルダ(既定は[ファイルの置き場所](#ファイルの置き場所))。 |
| `GENMODELFIT_CACHE_DIR` | `update`・`measure`・`share`・`bench`・`contrib` と、キャッシュした一覧を読むすべてのコマンド | キャッシュのフォルダ(既定は[ファイルの置き場所](#ファイルの置き場所))。 |
| `GENMODELFIT_SIGNING_KEY` | `python -m genmodelfit.signing sign` だけ(`genmodelfit` コマンドでは使わない) | データのリリースに署名する秘密鍵(PEM)。保守する人向け([release.ja.md](release.ja.md))。 |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`・`GH_TOKEN` | `share` | PR を送るのにそのまま使う GitHub のトークン(scope `public_repo` が要る)。保存したログインとデバイス認証に勝つ。 |
| `GENMODELFIT_GH_CLIENT_ID` | `share` | デバイス認証に使う GitHub の OAuth アプリの client id。空にするとデバイス認証を使わない(`GITHUB_TOKEN`・`GH_TOKEN` だけ)。 |

通信は、プロキシと証明書の環境変数(`HTTPS_PROXY`・`REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` など)にも従います。`~/.netrc` の資格情報は送りません。

## 保存できる設定(`genmodelfit config`)

`genmodelfit config set キー 値` は、設定のフォルダの `config.json` に設定を保存します。読むのはコマンドラインだけで、
Python の関数は読みません。キーは `comfyui-dir`(フォルダのパス)と `lang`(`en` か `ja`)です。
同じ設定を決める場所が複数あるときは、次の上のものが勝ちます。

1. コマンドラインのオプション(`--lang`・`--comfyui-dir`・`--output-dir`)
2. 環境変数(`GENMODELFIT_LANG`・`GENMODELFIT_COMFYUI_DIR`)
3. 保存した設定(`genmodelfit config`)
4. 既定(`lang` は `en`。ComfyUI のフォルダは、ちょうど 1 つ見つかったときだけ自動で使う)

`genmodelfit config` は、各設定とどこから来た値かを出します。詳しくは [download.ja.md](download.ja.md)。

## ファイルの置き場所

| | Windows | macOS | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| 設定のフォルダ(`config.json`) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\genmodelfit` | `~/Library/Application Support/genmodelfit` | `~/.config/genmodelfit`(か `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/genmodelfit`) |
| キャッシュのフォルダ | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\genmodelfit\\Cache` | `~/Library/Caches/genmodelfit` | `~/.cache/genmodelfit`(か `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/genmodelfit`) |

この PC の設定ファイルの場所は `genmodelfit config path` で分かります。`GENMODELFIT_CONFIG_DIR`・`GENMODELFIT_CACHE_DIR`
でフォルダを変えられます。設定のフォルダには `share` の GitHub のログイン(`github_token`。本人だけが読める。
`genmodelfit share --logout` で消す)も入ります。キャッシュには、`update` で取った一覧(`db.json`)、HEAD とファイルの見出しの確認の結果、
`measure`・`bench` の結果(`measurements/`。この PC の判定にも使う)、提出の下書きと失敗の記録(`submissions/`。`share` が送るもの)、
`share` で送った印(`submissions_shared.json`)、`measure`・`share` が起動した ComfyUI の出力(`comfyui-<日付>.log`)、
測るあいだの `measure.lock`(同時に測るのは 1 つの `measure` か `share` だけ)が入ります。
キャッシュのフォルダは消してもかまいません(同梱の一覧に戻ります。保存した結果も消えます)。

## 終了コード

| コード | 意味 |
|---|---|
| 0 | 成功。引数なしの `genmodelfit` は使い方を出して 0 で終わります。 |
| 1 | 失敗: モデルが無い・断った・聞かれて断った・通信の誤り・読めないファイル・検査に通らなかった、など。何が失敗かは、各コマンドの節に書いてあります。 |
| 2 | 使い方の誤り: 知らないオプション・正しくない値・足りない引数・略した同意のオプション・同時に使えないオプション。 |
| 3 | `contrib aggregate --report --fail-on-breach` だけ: 誤差が閾値を超えた。 |
| 130 | Ctrl+C で止めた。`download` はどの OS でも 130 を返し、途中まで落とした `.part` のファイルを残します。同じコマンドをもう一度実行すれば続きから落とします。ほかのコマンドは Python の決まりどおりに止まります: Linux・macOS では 130、Windows では 3221225786(0xC000013A。PowerShell の `$LASTEXITCODE` では -1073741510)。`bench`・`measure` は送った仕事を取り消して(genmodelfit が起動した ComfyUI も止めて)から 1 で終わります。`share` は測るのをやめ、そこまでのものを送るかに進んでから 130 で終わります。`measure`・`share` の質問で Ctrl+C を押すと 130 です。 |

`--json` のときも失敗は 1 で終わり、文は JSON の `error` にあります。

コマンドの節は、プログラムの引数の解釈から `tools/cli_reference.py` が作っているので、プログラムといつも一致します。
手で直さず、`src/genmodelfit/cli.py` の説明の文を直して `python tools/cli_reference.py` を実行してください
(このページが古いと `tests/test_commands_doc.py` が落ちます)。

`signing.py`(`GENMODELFIT_SIGNING_KEY`)・`github.py`(`GITHUB_TOKEN`・`GH_TOKEN`・`GENMODELFIT_GH_CLIENT_ID`)です。
